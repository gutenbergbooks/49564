in Justice to him acknowledge, it
could not have so done so soon, nor

directed and order’d the Copper-plate.

<span class="uppercase">
As</span> Buggs have been known
to be in <i>England</i> above
sixty Years, and every Season
increasing so upon us,
as to become terrible to almost every
Inhabitant in and about this Metro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>polis,
it were greatly to be wished
that some more learned Person than
my self, studious for the Good of
Human Kind, and the Improvement
of natural Knowledge, would have
oblig’d the Town with some Treatise,
Discourse or Lecture on that
nauseous venomous Insect.</p>

<p>But as none such have attempted
it, and I have ever since my return
from <i>America</i> made their destruction
my Profession, and was at
first much baffled in my Attempts
for want, (as I then believ’d, and
have since found) of truly knowing
the Nature of those intolerable Vermin:
I determined by all means possible
to try if I could discover and
find out as much of their Nature,
Feeding and Breeding, as might be
conducive to my being better able
to destroy them.</p>

<p>And tho’ in attempting it I must
own I had a View at private Gain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
as well as the publick Good; yet I
hope my Design will appear laudable,
and the Event answer both Ends.</p>

<p>The late Learned and truly Valuable
Dr. <i>Woodward</i>, to whom I
first communicated my Intent, not
only approv’d the Design, but also
the Methods which, I told him, I
design’d to pursue, to attain the desired
Effects: and at the same time
was so good to give me some useful
Hints and Instructions, the better to
accomplish an Affair, which he said
’twas his Opinion would be a general
Good.</p>

<p>Not to make this Acknowledgement
of his kind Assistance, would
be Ingratitude to my dear deceas’d
Friend.</p>

<p>As I had his Approbation at the
beginning, had he but liv’d till now,
I doubt not but the Discoveries I
have made would have appear’d so
considerable and useful, as might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
entitled me to his farther Friendship
and Assistance, in methodizing
this Treatise for Publication.</p>

<p>But depriv’d of him, my first
and greatest Encourager, I have
ventur’d to let it appear in the best
Dress my Capacity will admit.
Should the Stile and my Manner of
handling the Subject to be treated of,
appear uncouth and displease, I
hope the Usefulness of it to the Publick
will make some amends for that
Defect.</p>

<p>In treating on these Insects, some
part of the Discourse may perhaps at
first View appear surprizing, if not
incredible to the Readers: But by
giving them an account how I attain’d
my Knowledge, and by often
reiterated Experiments prov’d them
to be certain Facts, they will soon
alter their Opinion; and the whole,
I hope, will not only be acceptable,
diverting and instructive to the Rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>ders,
but also of universal Benefit
to the Inhabitants in and about <i>London</i>
and <i>Westminster</i>.</p>

<p>This Treatise being on a Subject
as much wanted as any whatever,
and the Pains and Trouble I have
taken to arrive at my Knowledge
herein, having been uncommon; it
may be expected by the Curious,
that I should give some of the Reasons
that first induced me to undertake
a Discovery so very difficult to
appearance.</p>

<p>It may not therefore be unnecessary
to acquaint such, that in the
Year 1726, my Affairs requiring
my going to the <i>West-Indies</i>, I had
not been long there arrived, before,
(the Climate not agreeing with my
Constitution) I fell sick, had a Complication
of the Country Distempers,
lost the Use of my Limbs, and was
given over by the best Physicians at
<i>Kingstown</i> in <i>Jamaica</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>But, contrary to their Expectation,
recovering a little, they advis’d
me to stay no longer in a
Country, so prejudicial and dangerous
to me, than till I could get Shipping
for <i>England</i>; and in the mean
time desired that as often as I was
able, I would ride out for the Benefit
of the Air; which as soon as I
had Strength enough, I did.</p>

<p>In one of my Journeys meeting
with an uncommon Negro, the Hair
or (rather) Wooll on his Head, Beard,
and Breast being as white as Snow,
I stopt my Horse to look on him;
and he coming, as their way is, to
beg a little Tobacco, I gave it, and
enquir’d if he had been always so
white-hair’d. He answer’d, no;
but Age had made him so.</p>

<p>Observing that he moved briskly,
had no Wrinkles, and all his Teeth, I
told him I could not believe him to
be very old, at the same time de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>siring
to know his Age. His Answer
was, he knew not himself; but this
he knew, that he was one of the first
Slaves brought into that Island, after
the <i>English</i> had taken it in <i>Oliver
Cromwell</i>’s time, and was then a
great Boy.</p>

<p>By this account I judged, and
might reasonably suppose him upwards
of ninety Years of Age.</p>

<p>Whilst we were in discourse, he
perceiving me often rub and scratch,
where my Face and Eyes were much
swelled with Bugg-Bites, asked if
Chintses, (so Buggs are by Negroes
and some others there called) had
bit me? On my answering, yes;
he said, he wonder’d white Men
should let them bite; they should do
something to kill them, as he did.</p>

<p>This unexpected Expression excited
in me a Curiosity to have farther
Discourse with him; and on my
telling him, that for my part I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
be extreme glad to know how to
destroy those Disturbers of my Rest,
and that if he would tell me how,
I would give him some more Tobacco
and a Bit, (a Piece of <i>Spanish</i>
Money, there current at Seven-pence
Half-Penny:) On this he agreed to
give me a Calibash full of Liquor,
which he said would certainly do
it, following the Directions he gave
me.</p>

<p>Possess’d of this, well pleas’d I
went home, and tho’ much fatigued,
I could not forbear using some of it
before I went to sleep; and to my
surprize, the instant I applied it,
vast Numbers did, (as he had told
me they would) come out of their
Holes, and die before my face.</p>

<p>These I swept up, threw away,
and went to Bed, and had much better
Rest than usual, not being Bugg-bit
then, as I always was before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>But what added to my Satisfaction,
and further surpriz’d me, was, that
when I got up I found many more
had come out in the Night and were
dead.</p>

<p>On this, I conceiv’d so great an
Opinion of the Goodness and Usefulness
of this Liquor, that I was resolved
to endeavour, and if possible
to prevail on him to teach me how
to make it; well knowing so valuable
a Secret was much wanted, and
would be highly useful, if I lived
to return to <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>In order to obtain it, I got some
<i>English</i> Beef, Pork, Biscuit and
Beer, and some Tobacco, believing
those sooner than Money or any other
thing would procure from the
Negro, what I so much wanted and
desired.</p>

<p>The next day early I went, and
finding my Negro in his Hutt, I
asked if he could dress me some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Victuals. On his replying, yes, if
he had it; I open’d my Store-Bags,
took out one Piece of Beef, some
Biscuits and a Bottle of Beer, taking
care at the same time he should see
the rest. We eat a Biscuit, drank
some Beer, and to dressing the Beef
with some Yams out of his Plantation,
he eagerly went: all Negroes
being greedy of Flesh, when they
can come at it; some of them not
eating any for many Years together,
but live altogether on the Produce of
the Earth.</p>

<p>Whilst he was intent on Cooking
and in a good Humour, I took the
Opportunity of telling him, I had
used and so well approved of his
Liquor, that if he would learn me
how to make it, all the Victuals and
Tobacco in the Bags, and what Liquor
we did not drink whilst I
staid, I would give to him, as a Recompence
for the Favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>At first he refused, believing me
(as I found by his discourse) to be a
<i>Creolian</i>, whom the Negroes in general
hate; but upon my convincing
him I was an <i>Englishman</i>, and returning
home, the good Chear prevail’d.</p>

<p>After eating together, into the
Woods and Savannahs we went, to
gather such of the Materials as grew
not on his Plantation, or that he had
not by him; and returning to his
Hutt, to making the Liquor he went.</p>

<p>I remark’d well, and set down
the Names, Quantities, and his way
of making and mixing the Composition;
which being done, all the
Bottles we emptied of Beer were fill’d
with the Liquor; with which I return’d
to <i>Kingstown</i>, being as well
pleas’d with my Discovery, as the
Negro was with my Presents.</p>

<p>Having thus obtain’d my most
material Point, I could not yet for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>bear
going every time I rode out, to
see and discourse my Negro, and never
went empty-handed, being desirous
to try if I could discover any
thing further from him or of him,
and how he attain’d the great Knowledge
I found he had in the medicinal
Virtues of Roots, Plants, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>He inform’d me, that during
about fifty Years that he was a Slave
(in which time six of his Masters had
died) he oft wish’d for Death, and
sought no means to preserve Life,
and was then so infirm, as to be
thought by his seventh Master to be
past labour; and having been a good
and faithful Slave, his said Master
gave him his Freedom, and the
piece of Ground I found him upon,
to live on.</p>

<p>That Liberty having render’d Life
more agreeable to him, he then studied
all means to preserve it, and
having some knowledge of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
proper to preserve as well as support
him, he had ever since planted, <i>&amp;c.</i>
in his Plantation, things proper for
Physick as well as Food.</p>

<p>And indeed his Ground might be
called a Physick-Garden, rather than
a Provision-Plantation; for of the
latter he only raised enough to support
himself, of the former to supply
others as well as himself, and frequently
made Medicines for his sick
Acquaintance and others with success.
This Account I had of him
from many, as well as from himself;
which made me entertain so good an
opinion of his Skill and Fidelity,
that I ventur’d to take a Medicine
made by him, by the use of which
I found great Benefit in the restoring
me to the Use of my Limbs.</p>

<p>’Twas owing to his Skill that he
had thus preserv’d himself to so great
an Age; and ’tis my Opinion, he
had attain’d to a greater knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the physical Use of the Vegetables
of that Country, than any illiterate
Person ever had done before him.</p>

<p>Believing some of the Materials
not to be had in <i>Europe</i>, I procured
of him a quantity, and soon after
returned to <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>On my arrival at <i>London</i> in <i>August</i>
1727, I made some Liquor to compare
with his, (which I found exactly
the same) whereupon I set about
destroying of Buggs, and found to
my Satisfaction, that wherever I apply’d
it, it brought out and kill’d
’em all. At length I advertis’d, had
great business, and pleased every
body, then apprehending no return
of the Vermin. But yet, to my surprize,
tho’ I had kill’d all the old
ones, young ones sometimes, in some
places, would appear.</p>

<p>To my Liquor’s being then so
strong and oleous, that I durst not
venture to liquor the Furniture for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
fear of damaging it, I at first attributed
the coming of those young Buggs.</p>

<p>Whereupon I studied to find an
Allay for that Quality; which at
length, after many Experiments, and
with much difficulty, I found out,
and to such a perfection, that I can
and do with safety liquor the richest
of Furniture, as well as the Wood-work
of Beds; and tho’ the staining
Quality be taken off, the valuable
attractive and destructive parts of the
Composition still retain their full
Virtue.</p>

<p>Having gain’d this great Point, I
then went on briskly, and destroyed
Buggs and Nits in all Beds and Furniture
wherever I came: But yet
Young Ones from behind Wainscot
and out of Walls would sometimes
afterwards appear, get to the Beds
for better quarters and food, and
become troublesome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>This much perplex’d me; but
these unforeseen and then unknown
Difficulties, which might have discouraged
a less enterprizing Genius,
prompted me the more to find the
Cause and Means to overcome them;
which I conjectur’d might best be
done, by finding their Nature and
Method of Breeding, Feeding, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In order to it, I enquir’d of many
Booksellers, if any Book concerning
them had ever been published; but
finding none, I then made it my
business to discourse as many learned,
curious, and antient Men as I possibly
could, concerning them; but all
that ever I could gather from either,
was the following Account, how
and when they were first known to
be brought and to breed in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p><i>Viz.</i> “That soon after the Fire of
<i>London</i>, in some of the new-built
Houses they were observ’d to appear,
and were never noted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
have been seen in the old, tho’
they were then so few, as to be
little taken notice of; yet as they
were only seen in Firr-Timber,
’twas conjectur’d they were then
first brought to <i>England</i> in them;
of which most of the new Houses
were partly built, instead of the
good Oak destroy’d in the old.”</p>

<p>In the above Account of their first
coming, Esquire <i>Pitfield</i> and Mr.
<i>White</i>, a Chymist, Men of great
Probity and Curiosity, agreed.</p>

<p>And as the Sap of Deal is one of
their beloved Foods, this probably
might be the first way they were
brought. How they are still brought,
I shall speak to more fully hereafter,
in my Instructions to avoid them.</p>

<p>Finding no satisfactory Account
of their Nature, Breeding, and Feeding,
to be come at from others, I
was resolved assiduously to set about
and try all possible ways to attain it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
myself. My first Step was to purchase
and try Microscopes, and all
such Helps as could be got, and to
devise such others as might contribute
thereto; by which I am enabled
to give you the following Descriptions
of Buggs, <i>&amp;c.</i> which the better to
illustrate, is annexed from a Copper-Plate,
curiously engraven by the
famous Mr. <i>Vandergucht</i>, the different
Species and Sizes of Buggs, as
well as one correctly and finely magnified.</p>

<p>I was not so fond of my own
Performance, as to think my Treatise
merited so great an Ornament.
But as the Learned and Judicious
Sir <span class="smcap">Hans Sloane</span> had done me the
Honour to peruse and approve of
my Manuscript, and thought it worthy
thereof, and also desired and directed
the doing the said Plate by so
good a Hand; I should have been
wanting to myself, had I not, in de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>ference
and respect to his Opinion
and Request, annex’d the same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Bugg’s Body is shaped and shelled,
and the Shell as transparent and
finely striped as the most beautiful
amphibious Turtle; has six Legs
most exactly shaped, jointed and
bristled as the Legs of a Crab. Its
Neck and Head much resembles a
Toad’s. On its Head are three
Horns picqued and bristled; and at
the end of their Nose they have a
Sting sharper and much smaller than
a Bee’s. The Use of their Horns is
in Fight to assail their Enemies, or
defend themselves. With the Sting
they penetrate and wound our Skins,
and then (tho’ the Wound is so
small as to be almost imperceptible)
they thence by Suction extract their
most delicious Food, our Blood.
This Sucking the Wound so given, is
what we improperly call biting us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>By often nightly watching and
daily observing them with the best
of Helps, having discover’d Males
from Females, I determin’d, and
then did put up a Pair in a Glass, as
believing that to keep them the
Year round, would be the only and
best way to find the Nature of their
breeding, feeding, <i>&amp;c.</i> and be a
means to discover what had occasion’d
the Difficulties I had met with
in my Endeavours and Practice of
destroying them.</p>

<p>As the Thought was <i>à propos</i>, and
the Event having answer’d Expectation,
I shall now inform you of my
Observations and Discoveries thereby
made.</p>

<p>As I put up the Pair aforesaid, so
did I another Pair that day Fortnight,
and so every Fortnight for eighteen
Months, did I put up others, with
various Foods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The first, second, third, and fourth
Pair lived, but did not presently
breed, it not being then their Season
of so doing: But in about ten Days
after I put up the fifth Pair, they all
spawn’d much about the time of each
other; and in about three Weeks
the Spawn came to life.</p>

<p>Of the Spawn and different Gradations
of Buggs, I shall now give
you an exact Account.</p>

<p>The Eggs or Nits are white, and
having when spawn’d a clammy
glutinous Substance, they flick to
any thing spawn’d upon, and by
Heat come to Maturity and Life.
The Eggs are oval, and as small as
the smallest Maw-feed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Buggs of one day old, are white
as Milk.</p>

<p>At three days old, are Cream-colour’d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>At one Week old, are Straw-colour’d.</p>

<p>At two Weeks, are of the same
Colour, with a red List down
the Back.</p>

<p>At three Weeks, List Copper Colour.</p>

<p>At four Weeks, List Browner.</p>

<p>At five Weeks, List deeper Brown.</p>

<p>At six Weeks, the Sides brown,
and the List hardly discernible.</p>

<p>At seven Weeks, they come to be
of their proper Colour, all over
brown.</p>

<p>At eight Weeks, they grow bigger.</p>

<p>Nine Weeks, Ditto.</p>

<p>Ten Weeks, Ditto.</p>

<p>At eleven Weeks, they are full
grown.</p></div>

<p><i>Vide</i> the Plate done from <i>Europeans</i>
bred: under which is a
single one longer and larger, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
our full-grown, being a full-grown
<i>American</i> bred. ’Tis needless to
give the Gradations of that Species,
because when they spawn and breed
here, the Young degenerate, and
are of the <i>European</i> Size.</p>

<p>As I wrote down the Time I put
up all Pairs for breeding, and also
the Times they spawn’d, and observ’d
and set down the Numbers they generally
spawn’d; I found by my account
of above forty Pair so put up
with various Foods, not only their
best-beloved Foods, but also their
Method of Breeding; of which, to
render my Observations of publick
Service, I shall give you an account.</p>

<p><i>Viz.</i> Their beloved Foods are
Blood, dry’d Paste, Size, Deal, Beach,
Osier, and some other Woods, the
Sap of which they suck; and on
any one of these will they live the
Year round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Oak, Walnut, Cedar and Mahogoney
they will not feed upon; all
Pairs I put up with those Woods for
Food, having been soon starved to
death.</p>

<p>Wild Buggs are watchful and
cunning, and tho’ timorous of us,
yet in fight one with another, are
very fierce; I having often seen some
(that I brought up from a day old,
always inur’d to Light and Company)
fight as eagerly as Dogs or Cocks,
and sometimes one or both have died
on the Spot. From those so brought
up tame, I made the greatest Discoveries.</p>

<p>They are hot in Nature, generate
often, and shoot their Spawn all at
once, and then leave it, as Fish do.</p>

<p>They generally spawn about fifty
at a time, of which Spawn about
forty odd in about three Weeks time
usually, (but sometimes two or three
days more or less, according as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Weather proves more or less hot)
come to life; the Residue proving
addle, as do often the Eggs of Hens,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Thus they spawn four times in a
Season; <i>viz.</i> in <i>March</i>, <i>May</i>, <i>July</i>,
and <i>September</i>: by which ’tis apparent
to a Demonstration, that
from every Pair that lives out the
Season, about two hundred Eggs or
Nits are produc’d; and that out of
them, one hundred and sixty, or one
hundred and seventy, come to Life
and Perfection.</p>

<p>Some of the first Breed I have
known to spawn the same Season
they were hatched; but so few in
Quantity, and those so weakly, that
the Winter killed them.</p>

<p>I have also observed that in Rooms
where constant Fires have been kept
Night and Day, they have been so
brisk and stout as to spawn in the
Depth of Winter: but of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Spawn I ever saw between <i>September</i>
and <i>March</i>, not one ever came to
Life.</p>

<p>This plainly evinces, that Natural
Heat only produces Life in the
Spawn, and that Artificial cannot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus having shewn plainly the
Number each Pair annually produce,
I hope their great Increase is so sufficiently
accounted for, that it need
no more be wonder’d at.</p>

<p>And having also shewn their seven
Months Season of Breeding, if ’tis
admitted, as I think ’tis plainly apparent,
that in the other five
Months, <i>viz.</i> from <i>September</i> to
<i>March</i>, when there is no such thing
as Spawn but what is addle, and
consequently cannot come to Maturity;
it then naturally follows, that the
Winter is the best Season for their
total Destruction: which I shall make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
more fully appear presently, but
must first refute two vulgar Errors.</p>

<p>The first is, That many People
imagine they are dead in Winter.
This is a Notion so absurd, that it
would hardly be worth mentioning,
had I not by Experience found it
had prevail’d with many People of
Sense and Learning, as well as the
Vulgar and Illiterate. The many
Experiments by me shown at the
Hospitals in the hardest Frosts last
Winter, and in the Houses of the
Nobility and Gentry, and to Sir
<span class="smcap">Hans Sloane</span> the 30th of <i>December</i>
1729, will, I hope, be deem’d a
sufficient Refutation of that Error:
For in the coldest Seasons the Application
of my Liquor with a Feather
only, made the Vermin bolt out of
their Holes, and die before their
faces.</p>

<p>This they will do all the Year
round in the coldest or hottest Wea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>ther.
And I have seen, and do assert,
they do bite in the cold as well as
hot Seasons: but as our Blood is not
so apt to inflame in Winter as in
Summer, their Bites make but little
Impression, and are consequently
the less regarded.</p>

<p>The second and most prevailing
Error is, That Buggs bite some Persons,
and not others: When in Reality
they bite every Human Body
that comes in their way; and this
I will undertake plainly to demonstrate
by Reason.</p>

<p>It is generally observ’d and granted,
that a Person under an ill Habit
of Body, if he receives a small
Cut or Wound, so slight as to be at
first thought a Trifle, such Person’s
Wound by reason of such ill Habit
shall be attended with Inflammations
and other dangerous Symptons, and
be longer under Cure than Wounds,
which when first receiv’d were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
larger, and consequently thought
more dangerous. These Wounds
shall be immediately healed on
Persons in good Habit of Body, such
good Habit preventing any Inflammations.</p>

<p>And as Fevers, and Swellings attending
and prolonging the Cure of
Fractures, are accounted for the same
way; why may it not by the same
parity of Reason be admitted, that
the Bite or Wound of a Bugg should
swell and inflame such only whose
Blood is out of order; and tho’ they
do bite, cause no Inflammations on
any in right order of Blood?</p>

<p>The best Reason which can be
given in support of this Error, is,
That where two Persons lie in one
Bed, one shall be apparently bit, the
other not.</p>

<p>Buggs indeed, where there are
two Sorts, may feed most on that
Blood which best pleases their Palate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
but that they do taste the other also,
to me is apparent: And whenever
that Bedfellow who is most liked by
Buggs shall lie from home, the other
will so sensibly feel the effects to be as
above, that they will no longer think
themselves bite-free.</p>

<p>Of this I am sensible, that I daily
am bit when practising and at work
in my Business, destroying them;
and as they never swell me but when
out of order, from thence I infer,
that not only myself, but all such
who are among Buggs, and do not
swell with their Bites, are certainly
in good Habit of Body. But to return
to my Subject.</p>

<p>Having shewn that they not only
live in Winter, but asserted that to
be the best Season for their total Destruction,
I must further observe, that
few People caring to trouble themselves
about Buggs but when they
themselves are troubled by them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
having confin’d the Attempts for their
Destruction chiefly to the Breeding-Season,
has been the sole Reason why
the best Efforts for their Destruction
have fail’d.</p>

<p>I do admit innumerable Quantities
have been destroy’d, and much
good has and may be done in Summer:
but should every old Bugg
then be destroy’d, you are yet not
safe; for the Nits behind Wainscot
and in Walls, which cannot be come
at, will by heat come to life, and
your work is partly to be done over
again.</p>

<p>Whereas, on the contrary, if cleared
out of Spawning-time, there is
a certainty, as there is then no Nits,
that their Offspring cannot plague
you thereafter.</p>

<p>’Tis for this Reason I warrant
what I do in Winter; which I cannot
pretend to do in Summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>In Summer indeed I do destroy
all Buggs and Nits too in Beds and
their Furniture, but Buggs only behind
Wainscot and in Walls: for
tho’ my Liquor has an attractive as
well as the destructive Quality, and
thereby does bring out and destroy
every live Bugg; yet their Nits being
inanimate, cannot come to the Liquor,
nor the Liquor at them. Such
Nits therefore will come to life by
heat, and quit the Walls and Wainscot
for better Quarters and Food in
the Bed, and so become troublesome
to you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having thus given, I hope, a satisfactory
Account of this nauseous,
venomous Vermin, I shall proceed to
shew how they are daily brought to
<i>England</i>, and into Houses commonly;
then give some necessary Cautions
how to avoid them, and Directions
how to destroy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>As these Insects abound in all
foreign Parts, especially in hotter
Climates more than they do here;
’tis on that account all Trading Ships
are so over-run with them, that hardly
any one thing, if examin’d, will be
found free.</p>

<p>And as by Shipping they were
doubtless first brought to <i>England</i>,
so are they now daily brought. This
to me is apparent, because not one
Sea-Port in <i>England</i> is free; whereas
in Inland-Towns, Buggs are hardly
known.</p>

<p>This Metropolis therefore, as having
the greatest Number of Shipping,
has had the greatest Number imported,
and consequently bred in it.</p>

<p>You that are free, and would avoid
a foreign Supply in your Houses,
examine well all things from on
board Ships before you admit them
into Lodging-Rooms. Chests and
Casks, Linnens, and Paper, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
stiffened with Paste, afford them Food,
and are consequently most dangerous.</p>

<p>If you have occasion to change
Servants, let their Boxes, Trunks,
<i>&amp;c.</i> be well examin’d before carried
into your Rooms, lest their coming
from infected Houses should prove
dangerous to yours.</p>

<p>Examine well all Furniture that
comes in, before you set it up, Beds
especially; which I recommend
should be plain, and as free from
Wood-work as possible, and made
to draw out, that the Wainscot and
Walls may be better come at, to clear
them from Buggs and Dirt.</p>

<p>Deal Head-Boards, and Head-Cloths
lined with Deal, or Rails of
that Wood, avoid.</p>

<p>Also Beach-Bedsteds, for all such
afford them much Harbour and
Food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>If for Ornament you use Lace,
let it be sewed, not pasted on, for
Paste they love much.</p>

<p>Oak-Bedsteds, and plain Wainscot
Head-Boards, and Tester-Rails
of that Wood, allow them the least
Harbour, and no Food; such therefore
I recommend.</p>

<p>If you put out your Linnen to
wash, let no Washer-woman’s Basket
be brought into your Houses; for
they often prove as dangerous to
those that have no Buggs, as Cradles,
and Bugg-Traps made of the same
Wood, often do to those that have
them: for the Wood they are made
of, affords them much Convenience
of Harbour, and great Nourishment.</p>

<p>Upholsterers are often blamed in
Bugg-Affairs; the only Fault I can
lay to their Charge, is their Folly, or
rather Inadvertency, in suffering old
Furniture, when they have taken it
down, because it was buggy, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
brought into their Shops or Houses,
among new and free Furniture, to
infect them.</p>

<p>Builders are more blameable than
they: for in Houses built for Sale,
old Wainscot-Doors, Chimney-Pieces,
&amp;c. are oft put up for Cheapness,
painted over, and pass for new;
thus the Houses in <i>Hanover</i> and
<i>Grosvenor-Squares</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> were supplied
before inhabited.</p>

<p>In taking of Houses, new or old,
and in buying Bedsteds, Furniture,
<i>&amp;c.</i> examine carefully if you can
find Bugg-marks. If you find such,
though you see not the Vermin, you
may assure yourself they are nevertheless
infected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To such as have, and would destroy
them, I shall now proceed to
give full Directions. In order to
do it effectually, and to lessen your
trouble, the first necessary thing to be
known, is their Marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Buggs, tho’ nasty to us, are so
cleanly to themselves, that they quit
their places of Harbour to come out
and dung, and their Excrements
leave a Mark or Stain like that of a
Fly, but somewhat blacker; and
wherever you see such Marks, if on
Wood, look for the nearest Crevise,
Knot, or Streak; if on Walls, for
the nearest Crack or Hole; if on
Furniture, for the nearest Seam,
Lace, Tape, or Fold, and there assuredly
are the Vermin, and there
apply the Remedy.</p>

<p>In Winter-time, few, if any, are
to be found by day-light in the
Furniture of a Bed; but in the Wood-work,
Wainscot, or Walls only.</p>

<p>In the Summer they are all over,
and every Lace, Tape, Seam and
Fold must be examin’d, as well as
the Crevises, Joints, and Carving in
the Wood-work, for the Marks, and
the Remedy applied accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In Winter-time, though they lie
in pretty close Quarters, yet are they
easily destroy’d with any thing that
will attract or entice them to it.</p>

<p>If no such thing you have, give
me leave to recommend my Liquor;
on the Application of which, at all
Seasons of the Year, they will come
out, and immediately die before
your Face.</p>

<p>In Summer they lie in more open
Quarters, and spread, and then are
not in any measure to be reduced,
but by such Liquors as you may
safely touch the Furniture with all
over: if none such you have, you
may depend that mine will not stain
or any way hurt the richest Velvet,
Silk, or Stuff, not even Scarlet, which
almost every thing else will do.</p>

<p>On account of these excellent Qualifications,
the Liquor has its Name
of <i>Nonpareil</i>, and of this, if minded
to do it yourself, you may have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Bottle for 2 <i>s.</i> sufficient for a common
Bed, with plain Directions how
to use it effectually.</p>

<p>If the Trouble of doing it your
selves be disagreeable to you, you
may have it expeditiously done by
me or my Servants, and your Beds,
or such Part as is necessary, taken
down and put up again in full as
good, if not better Order, than
they were before, and alter’d, (if I
see Opportunity or Occasion) and
made to draw out, on my usual
easy Terms.</p>

<p>As I have occasionally mention’d
what Sort of Beds I would have
you avoid, give me leave to add
and assure you, that Beds may be
made full as warm as usual, and very
ornamental, and yet be so very handy,
as that any one of your own Servants
might take all down and clear
them of Buggs, Dirt, and Dust, and
put them up again in a quarter of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Hour; and to this Fashion most
Beds may be alter’d, several Persons
having lately done so by my Directions
to their very great Satisfaction.</p>

<p>Those that have a mind to have
new Beds thus made, or old ones
alter’d, are to observe, That the
Head-posts of the Bedsted are to
be no higher than just to support a
Wainscot Head-board, the Tester-lath
supports the Rod as usual; in
the Rail are to be nine Holes drilled
in, but not quite thro’; the two at
the Head, to take off and hang on,
(at Pleasure,) two Upholders drove
into the Wainscot or Wall; in the
other seven, thro’ Eye-let Holes, at
proper Distances in the Tester-cloth,
are to be seven Balls or carved
Branches to keep the Tester-Cloth
tight; to which the Head-cloth,
and inside and outside Vallens are
to be fixed: so that by taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Lath of the Upholders, and taking
out the Balls, they all come off together;
and thus made, may be commodiously
and immediately clear’d,
clean’d, and put up again, to fasten
on the Head-board: And keep
your Head-cloth down tight in its
Place and Form. You have Hooks
and Eyes to take on and off at Pleasure.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
